# Developer Track Hackathon - Building Intelligent Apps

This hackathon will provide a deep dive experience targeted for developers by integrating AI solutions into applications. Hackathon is a collaborative learning experience, designed as a set of challenges to practice your technical skills. By participating in this hackathon, you will be able to understand the capabilities of integrating AI services into applications.

This workshop requires two full days to finish depending on the attendees' skill level. It is a collaborative activity where attendees form teams of 3-5 people to go through every workshop.
  
## Learning Objectives
Upon completing the workshop, participants will be able to:
- Understand the fundamentals of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and its implementation using Azure OpenAI.
- Integrate Azure AI Search with RAG to enhance AI applications with contextually relevant data.
- Design and build a QnA copilot system utilizing prompt flow in Azure AI Studio for efficient user interaction.
- Develop intelligent applications using Semantic Kernel in either C# or Python, incorporating AI prompts seamlessly.
- Apply the learned concepts to create innovative solutions that address real-world challenges using Azure OpenAI.
  
## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with Azure services and the Azure portal.
- Basic understanding of AI and generative models.
- Experience in programming with C# or Python
- Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio
- Azure Subscription with OpenAI access. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing this [form](https://aka.ms/oai/access). Ensure that you register for approval to access and use the Azure OpenAI models before attending the workshop. The approval process may take up to 48 hours to copmlete.

## Target Audience
The intended audience comprises individuals who have coding skills.
- AI Engineers
- Software Developers
- Solution Architects

## Day 1 Challenges
