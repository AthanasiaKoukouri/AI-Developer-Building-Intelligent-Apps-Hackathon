# Challenge 03 - Start coding with Azure OpenAI SDK

 [< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-04.md)

## Introduction
After completing the prompt flow challenge, it's time to start investigating, how you can write code to utilize the AI services.

The Azure OpenAI library configures a client for use with Azure OpenAI and provides additional strongly typed extension support for request and response models specific to Azure OpenAI scenarios.

## Description
Now youâ€™ll dive into .NET Core development by creating a simple console application and use your own data with Azure OpenAI models created in previous challenge.

You can also use the Azure Open AI SDK of another programming language of your preference.

In a console window use the dotnet new command to create a new console app. 

```bash
dotnet new console -n azure-openai-sdk-hackathon
```

Install the OpenAI .NET client library with:

```bash
dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI --prerelease
```

Add your environmental variables
```bash
string endpoint = "<Add AOAI GPT Enpoint>";
string deploymentName = "<Add AOAI GPT Key>";
string openAiApiKey = "<Add AOAI GPT Deployment name>";

string searchEndpoint = "<Add Azure Search Enpoint>";
string searchIndex = "<Add Azure Search Key>";
string searchApiKey = "<Add Azure Search Index for eCommerce products>";
```

Create client with an API key. While not as secure as Microsoft Entra-based authentication, it's possible to authenticate using a client subscription key:

```bash
AzureOpenAIClient azureClient = new(
    new Uri(endpoint),
    new ApiKeyCredential(openAiApiKey));
ChatClient chatClient = azureClient.GetChatClient(deploymentName);
```

Use your own data with Azure OpenAI

```bash
#pragma warning disable AOAI001

//Add chat completion options with data source 
ChatCompletionOptions options = new ChatCompletionOptions();
options.AddDataSource(new AzureSearchChatDataSource()
{
    Endpoint = new Uri(searchEndpoint),
    IndexName = searchIndex,
    Authentication = DataSourceAuthentication.FromApiKey(searchApiKey),
});

//Add system message and user question
List<ChatMessage> messages = new List<ChatMessage>();
messages.Add(ChatMessage.CreateSystemMessage("You are an AI assistant that helps people find product information."));
messages.Add(ChatMessage.CreateUserMessage("<Type your question here.>"));

ChatCompletion completion = chatClient.CompleteChat(messages, options);
```

Use the above code as an example and do all necessary changes to meet the success criteria.
You should make your application acting like a chat bot by adding conversation history as context for the subsequent calls.

## Success Criteria

- Demonstrate that you can chat with your own data.
- Demonstrate that the user can ask questions on your own data within the application.
- Demonstrate that you set the behavior of the bot as a product information application.
- Demonstrate that you use the conversation history as context for the subsequent calls.
- (Optional) Demonstrate that you can stream the response chat messages.
- Discuss with your coach alternative ways authenticating with Azure AI services.
